# Incident Management

## Runbooks

1. **Document Common Incidents**:
   - Create detailed runbooks for common incidents, outlining steps to diagnose and resolve issues.
   - Include relevant logs, metrics, and dashboards to check, along with troubleshooting steps.

2. **Runbook Format**:
   - Standardize the format of runbooks to ensure consistency.
   - Include sections such as Incident Description, Symptoms, Immediate Actions, Detailed Steps, Escalation Procedures, and Post-Incident Actions.

3. **Accessible Repository**:
   - Store runbooks in a centralized and easily accessible repository, such as Confluence, Git, or an internal wiki.
   - Ensure runbooks are version-controlled and regularly updated.

## Postmortems

1. **Blameless Postmortems**:
   - Conduct postmortems for all major incidents, focusing on understanding the root cause and improving processes.
   - Ensure a blameless culture to encourage open and honest discussions.

2. **Root Cause Analysis (RCA)**:
   - Perform a thorough RCA to identify the underlying cause of the incident.
   - Use methods like the 5 Whys, Fishbone Diagram, or Fault Tree Analysis to uncover root causes.

3. **Action Items**:
   - Define actionable items to prevent the recurrence of the incident.
   - Assign owners and deadlines for each action item and track their completion.

## Blameless Culture

1. **Promote Transparency**:
   - Encourage team members to report incidents and near-misses without fear of blame.
   - Foster a culture of continuous learning and improvement.

2. **Incident Review Meetings**:
   - Hold regular incident review meetings to discuss recent incidents and share learnings.
   - Use these meetings to identify patterns and areas for improvement.
