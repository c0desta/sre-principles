# Welcome to the SRE Principles Guide

This site is a living collection of Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) best practices, built from over eight years of hands-on experience in building and maintaining scalable, reliable, and efficient systems.

## Our Core Philosophy

Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) is what you get when you treat operations as a software problem. Our mission is to protect, provide for, and progress the software and systems behind all of our services. We aim to balance the risk of unavailability with the goal of rapidly and safely launching new features.

This guide is designed to be a practical resource for SREs, developers, and operations engineers. Whether you are new to the field or an experienced practitioner, we hope you find these principles valuable.
