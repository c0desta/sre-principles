# SRE Best Practices: A Guide Based on 8-9 Years of Experience

This document outlines a set of Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) best practices, drawing from extensive hands-on experience. These principles are designed to help build and maintain scalable, reliable, and efficient systems.

## Core Philosophy

Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) is a discipline that incorporates aspects of software engineering and applies them to infrastructure and operations problems. The main goal is to create scalable and highly reliable software systems.

At its heart, SRE is what you get when you treat operations as a software problem. Our mission is to protect, provide for, and progress the software and systems behind all of our services. We aim to balance the risk of unavailability with the goal of rapidly and safely launching new features.

## CI/CD Pipelines

### Automated Testing

1.  **Unit Tests**:
    -   Write unit tests for individual components or functions using testing frameworks like MSTest, NUnit, or xUnit for .NET, and pytest or unittest for Python.
    -   Ensure unit tests cover edge cases and are executed during every code change.

2.  **Integration Tests**:
    -   Develop integration tests to verify interactions between different components and services.
    -   Use tools like Postman, REST Assured, or Testcontainers to facilitate integration testing.

3.  **End-to-End (E2E) Tests**:
    -   Implement end-to-end tests to simulate user interactions and validate the complete application flow.
    -   Use frameworks like Selenium, Cypress, or Puppeteer for E2E testing.
    -   Automate the execution of E2E tests in the CI/CD pipeline.

4.  **Continuous Testing**:
    -   Integrate all types of tests (unit, integration, E2E) into the CI/CD pipeline to ensure they run automatically on each code commit.
    -   Use CI tools like Azure DevOps Pipelines and GitLab CI to orchestrate the testing process.

### Continuous Deployment

1.  **Pipeline Design**:
    -   Design CI/CD pipelines in Azure DevOps and GitLab CI to automate the build, test, and deployment process.
    -   Break down the pipeline into stages, such as source, build, test, and deploy.

2.  **Artifact Management**:
    -   Use artifact repositories like Azure Artifacts or GitLab Package Registry to store build artifacts.
    -   Version artifacts and ensure they are immutable once published.

3.  **Deployment Strategies**:
    -   Implement deployment strategies like Blue-Green Deployments, Canary Releases, or Rolling Updates to minimize downtime and reduce risk.
    -   Use AWS ECS for container orchestration and deployment.

### Rollback Mechanisms

1.  **Automated Rollbacks**:
    -   Configure pipelines to automatically roll back to the previous stable version in case of deployment failures.
    -   Use health checks and monitoring tools to detect deployment issues quickly.

2.  **Feature Flags**:
    -   Implement feature flags to enable or disable features without deploying new code.
    -   Use feature flagging tools like LaunchDarkly, Unleash, or Flagr to manage feature rollouts.

## Collaboration and Communication

### Cross-Functional Teams

1.  **Regular Syncs**:
    -   Schedule regular sync meetings between cross-functional teams, such as development, QA, operations, and product management.
    -   Use these meetings to discuss ongoing projects, align on goals, and address any cross-team dependencies.

2.  **Clear Roles and Responsibilities**:
    -   Define and communicate clear roles and responsibilities for each team member.
    -   Ensure everyone understands their role in the project lifecycle and how they contribute to the overall success.

3.  **Shared Goals and KPIs**:
    -   Establish shared goals and key performance indicators (KPIs) that align with the organizationâ€™s objectives.
    -   Use these metrics to track progress and ensure all teams are working towards common objectives.

### Effective Communication

1.  **Communication Tools**:
    -   Use communication tools like Slack, Microsoft Teams, or Discord for real-time communication and collaboration.
    -   Create channels or groups for different teams or projects to facilitate focused discussions.

2.  **Documentation of Communication**:
    -   Document important discussions, decisions, and action items from meetings and conversations.
    -   Use tools like Confluence or internal wikis to store and share meeting notes and key takeaways.

3.  **Feedback Mechanisms**:
    -   Implement regular feedback mechanisms to gather input from team members on communication practices.
    -   Use surveys, retrospectives, or one-on-one meetings to solicit feedback and make improvements.

## Service Level Management: SLIs, SLOs, and Error Budgets

Service Level Indicators (SLIs), Service Level Objectives (SLOs), and Error Budgets are the cornerstone of SRE, providing a data-driven framework for managing service reliability. They allow teams to balance innovation with reliability by making informed decisions based on user-centric metrics.

For a detailed explanation of SLIs, SLOs, SLAs, and Error Budgets, including formulas and examples, please see the dedicated document:
-   [**Service Level Management**](./service-level-mgt.md)

## Toil Reduction

Toil is the manual, repetitive, and automatable work that scales with service growth. A core goal of SRE is to eliminate toil, freeing up engineers for high-value engineering projects that improve service reliability and features.

For a detailed guide on identifying, measuring, and eliminating toil, please see the dedicated document:

## Compliance and Security

### Compliance

1.  **Regulatory Requirements**:
    -   Identify and understand relevant regulatory requirements, such as GDPR, HIPAA, or SOC 2, that apply to your industry and organization.
    -   Implement policies and procedures to ensure compliance with these regulations.

2.  **Compliance Tools**:
    -   Use cloud provider tools to assist with compliance management, such as AWS Artifact, Azure Compliance Manager, or GCP Compliance Reports.
    -   Regularly review and update compliance status based on tool recommendations and audit findings.

3.  **Audits and Assessments**:
    -   Schedule regular internal and external audits to assess compliance with regulatory requirements.
    -   Address any findings or non-compliance issues identified during audits and document corrective actions.
